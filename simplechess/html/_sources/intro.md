# Not another Chess Book

I'm an avarage chess player.

Nowadays chess engine on protable devices easely defeat human play. This is not surprising, since computers have the capability to evaluate thousend of move combinations in few seconds, while the human mind can compute few moves in avance at best.

After introducing the basic rules of chess, and some examples at different stages of the game, I'll introduce the concpet of using Machine Intelligence to understand game patterns, and how to use such computational capabilities to empower and teach the human mind to reach its potential. For those skeptical on the possiblity of using machines to enhance human learning, we provide compelling evidence for the power of mind-machine interaction with a short analysis of the history of chess.
